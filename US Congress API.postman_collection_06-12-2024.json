Inhofe National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2023. </p> <p>TITLE III--IMMIGRATION EXTENSIONS </p> <p>(Sec. 301) This section extends through FY2023 the authorization for the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services E-Verify Program. (E-Verify is an internet-based system that allows businesses to determine the eligibility of their employees to work in the United States.) </p> <p>(Sec. 302) This section extends through FY2023 the special immigrant program for non-minister religious workers. (The program allows non-ministers in religious vocations and occupations to immigrate to or adjust status in the United States for the purpose of performing religious work in a full-time compensated position.) </p> <p>(Sec. 303) This section extends through FY2023 the authority of DHS to increase the numerical limitation on the number of aliens that that are permitted to enter the United States under the H-2B visa program for temporary nonagricultural labor. It also specifies that the limit may not exceed the highest number of H-2B nonimmigrants who participated in the H-2B returning worker program in any year in which returning workers were exempt from the numerical limitation. </p> <p>(Sec. 304) This section extends through FY2023 the authority under the Conrad State Program (also known as the Conrad 30 Program) to waive the two-year home country physical presence requirement for foreign medical graduates who have expiring J-1 visas, apply to remain in the United States, and commit to working in medically underserved areas for at least three years. </p> <p>TITLE IV--ENVIRONMENT AND PUBLIC WORKS MATTERS</p> <p> (Sec. 401) This section establishes a federal regional commission for the Great Lakes region. (Federal regional commissions are congressionally chartered, federal-state partnerships that seek to address economic distress in their designated regions.) </p> <p>For the purposes of the commission, the Great Lakes region includes areas in the watershed of the Great Lakes and the Great Lakes System in Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. </p> <p>(Sec. 402) This section reauthorizes through FY2027 various U.S. Fish and Wildlife authorities and programs related to the acceptance of gifts, volunteer services, community partnerships, and refuge education programs. </p> <p>(Sec. 404) This section renames the Lake Champlain Basin Program as the Patrick Leahy Lake Champlain Basin Program.

The temporary order expires on December 31, 2022. </p> <p>TITLE VII--FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION OVERSIGHT OF HORSERACING INTEGRITY AND SAFETY AUTHORITY </p> <p>(Sec. 701) This section expands the authority of the Federal Trade Commission to oversee the Horseracing Integrity and Safety Authority by abrogating, adding to, and modifying the rules issued by the authority. (In a November 2022 decision, The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit held that the law that created the authority is unconstitutional because Congress impermissibly delegated the powers of the FTC to the private Horseracing Integrity and Safety Authority by giving the FTC only limited powers to review the authority's rules.) </p> <p>TITLE VIII--UNITED STATES PAROLE COMMISSION EXTENSION </p> <p><i>United States Parole Commission Additional Extension Act of 2022 </i></p> <p>(Sec. 801) This section extends the U.S. Parole Commission. </p> <p>TITLE IX--EXTENSION OF FCC AUCTION AUTHORITY </p> <p>(Sec. 901) This section extends the authority of the Federal Communications Commission to conduct auctions for electromagnetic spectrum licenses through March 9. 2023. </p> <p>TITLE X--BUDGETARY EFFECTS </p> <p>(Sec. 1001) This section exempts the budgetary effects of this division and each succeeding division from (1) the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010 (PAYGO Act), (2) the Senate PAYGO rule, and (3) certain budget scorekeeping rules. </p> <p>This section also requires certain debits on the FY2023 and FY2024 scorecards maintained under the PAYGO Act to be transferred to the FY2025 scorecards. </p> <p>(The PAYGO Act generally prohibits direct spending and revenue legislation from increasing the budget deficit. PAYGO scorecards are used to enforce the requirements and determine whether a sequestration order implementing spending cuts is necessary.) </p> <p>DIVISION P--ELECTORAL COUNT REFORM AND PRESIDENTIAL TRANSITION IMPROVEMENT</p> <p><i>Electoral Count Reform and Presidential Transition Improvement Act of 2022</i></p> <p>TITLE I--ELECTORAL COUNT REFORM ACT</p> <p><i>Electoral Count Reform Act of 2022</i></p> <p>(Sec. 102) This section specifies that the choice of electors must occur in accordance with the laws of the state enacted prior to election day.</p> <p>(Sec. 103) This section specifies that states may fill vacancies in the electoral college in accordance with the laws of the state enacted prior to election day.</p> <p>(Sec. 104) This section identifies each state's governor (unless otherwise identified in the laws or constitution of a state in effect on election day) as responsible for submitting the certificate of ascertainment identifying the state's electors. It also provides for expedited judicial review for any action brought by an aggrieved presidential or vice-presidential candidate arising under the U.S. Constitution or U.S. laws with respect to the issuance or transmission of such a certificate.</p> <p>(Sec. 105) This section specifies the duties of the Archivist of the United States as it relates to the certificate of ascertainment of appointment of electors.</p> <p>(Sec. 106) This section changes when the electors of each state must meet to cast their votes for President and Vice President. Specifically, the electors must meet and give their votes on the first Tuesday (previously, Monday) after the second Wednesday in December. Additionally, the meeting place in each state must be designated prior to election day in accordance with the laws of the state.</p> <p>(Sec. 107) This section revises the process for the transmission of certificates of votes. In particular, the electors must immediately transfer at the same time and by the most expeditious method available the certificates of votes with the annexed certificates of ascertainment of appointment of electors.</p> <p>(Sec. 108) This section requires the President of the Senate or the Archivist of the United States to request, in the event of a failure to receive a certificate of electoral vote by a certain time, that the chief election officer transmit one of the copies they hold to the President of the Senate by the most expeditious method available. (Previously, the secretary of state had to transmit a copy by registered mail.) It also removes the penalty for a messenger's neglect of duty.</p> <p>(Sec. 109) This section revises the framework for the joint session of Congress to count electoral votes and make a formal declaration of which candidates have been elected President and Vice President. In particular, the section (1) specifies that the role of the President of the Senate during the joint session shall be ministerial in nature, and (2) raises the objection threshold in Congress to at least one-fifth of the duly chosen and sworn members of both the House of Representatives and the Senate.</p> <p>(Sec. 110) This section revises the procedure for joint session challenges to electoral vote returns by (1) requiring all objections and questions permitted with respect to the state to be considered during that time, and (2) requiring the presiding officer of each chamber to put each of the objections and questions to a vote without further debate.</p> <p>TITLE II--PRESIDENTIAL TRANSITION IMPROVEMENT ACT</p> <p><i>Presidential Transition Improvement Act</i></p> <p>(Sec. 202) This section revises provisions related to the presidential transition process. In particular, the section (1) allows more than one candidate to receive federal transition resources under certain circumstances, and (2) requires additional reporting by the General Services Administration.</p> <p>DIVISION Q--AVIATION RELATED MATTERS</p> <p>(Sec. 101) This section establishes a pilot grant program to support advanced air mobility (AAM) infrastructure. AAM infrastructure refers to an air transportation system that transports individuals and property between points in the United States in both controlled and uncontrolled airspace using certain aircraft, including remotely piloted, autonomous, or vertical take-off and landing aircraft.</p> <p>The Department of Transportation (DOT) must award planning grants for AAM infrastructure to (1) state, local, or tribal governments; (2) airport sponsors; (3) transit agencies; (4) port authorities; (5) metropolitan planning organizations; or (6) consortia of such entities. Entities that receive these grants must develop a comprehensive plan for AAM infrastructure, including vertiports (sites that support the landing, takeoff, loading, and other operations of AAM aircraft). Topics covered in the plan must address matters such as identifying locations for AAM infrastructure and available sources of funding. DOT must brief Congress about the plans it receives. The briefing must include an evaluation of the planned or proposed locations for vertiports and a description of best practices or lessons learned through the review of comprehensive plans.</p> <p>Grants may not be awarded after September 30, 2024.</p> <p><i>Samya Rose Stumo National Air Grant Fellowship Program Act of 2022</i></p> <p>(Sec. 102) This section commemorates the lives lost as a result of Boeing 737 MAX 8 airplane crashes.</p> <p>In particular, the section changes the name of the National Air Grant Fellowship Program to the Samya Rose Stumo National Air Grant Fellowship Program in honor of a public health advocate who died in one of the crashes. (The fellowship provides graduate students in aerospace engineering and related fields with aviation policy experience.)</p> <p>(Sec. 103) This section authorizes DOT to provide temporary insurance for air carriers with terminated war risk liability coverage.</p> <p>(Sec. 104) This section eliminates a restriction on retired or former officers of the Armed Forces serving as the Deputy Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration.</p> <p>(Sec. 105) This section directs DOT to develop a national aviation preparedness plan for communicable disease outbreaks, including to (1) create a process to identify appropriate personal protective equipment for individuals such as flight attendants to reduce the likelihood of exposure to a communicable disease that has the potential to cause an epidemic or pandemic of infectious disease that would constitute a public health emergency of international concern (i.e., a covered communicable disease); and (2) improve coordination between airports, air carriers, and governmental entities with respect to preparing for and responding to communicable disease outbreaks.</p> <p>In developing the plan, DOT must consult with aviation industry and labor stakeholders such as air carriers.</p> <p>The Government Accountability Office must conduct a study assessing the plan, including (1) whether the plan meets the obligations of the United States under international conventions and treaties, and (2) the extent to which the U.S. aviation system is prepared to respond to an outbreak of a covered communicable disease.</p> <p>(Sec. 106) This section directs DOT to establish an Aerospace Supply Chain Resiliency Task Force to identify and assess risks to the U.S. aerospace supply chain and identify best practices and make recommendations to mitigate such risks.</p> <p>The task force must convene for an initial meeting within 120 days after enactment of this act and at least every 90 days thereafter. It must also report to Congress on the activities it carries out, including recommendations for regulatory, policy, or legislative action to improve government efforts to reduce barriers, mitigate risk, and bolster the resiliency of the U.S. aerospace supply chain.</p> <p>The task force shall terminate upon submission of the report to Congress.</p> <p>(Sec. 107) This section revises the age standards for pilots to allow air carriers that meet certain criteria to employ pilots until they are 70 years of age.</p> <p>DIVISION R--NO TIKTOK ON GOVERNMENT DEVICES</p> <p><i>No TikTok on Government Devices Act</i></p> <p>(Sec. 102) This section requires the social media video application TikTok to be removed from the information technology of federal agencies.</p> <p>Specifically, it requires the Office of Management and Budget to develop standards for executive agencies that require TikTok and any successor application from the developer to be removed from agency information technology (e.g., devices). Such standards must include exceptions for law enforcement activities, national security interests, and security researchers.</p> <p>DIVISION S--OCEANS RELATED MATTERS</p> <p>TITLE I--DRIFTNET MODERNIZATION</p> <p><i>Driftnet Modernization and Bycatch Reduction Act</i></p> <p>This title addresses certain driftnet fishing. Driftnet fishing is a method of fishing in which a gillnet composed of a panel or panels of webbing, or a series of such gillnets, is placed in the water and allowed to drift with the currents and winds for the purpose of entangling fish in the webbing.</p> <p>(Sec. 102) Currently, the use of large-scale drift gillnets with a total length of 2.5 kilometers or more is prohibited in the United States. This section expands the definition of large-scale driftnet fishing to prohibit the use of gillnets with a mesh size of 14 inches or greater. This expanded prohibition does not apply within the U.S. exclusive economic zone for five years.</p> <p>(Sec. 104) The Department of Commerce must conduct a transition program to facilitate the phase out of large-scale driftnet fishing and to promote the adoption of alternative fishing practices that minimize the incidental catch of living marine resources.</p> <p>Commerce must award grants to program participants.</p> <p>(Sec. 106) The North Pacific Fishery Management Council may recommend and Commerce may approve regulations that require charter operators to pay fees on vessels that harvest Pacific halibut in specific International Pacific Halibut Commission regulatory areas.</p> <p>TITLE II--FISHERY RESOURCE DISASTERS IMPROVEMENT</p> <p><i>Fishery Resource Disasters Improvement Act</i></p> <p>This title revises the Fisheries Resource Disaster Relief Program and repeals or revises certain reporting requirements.</p> <p>The title revises the procedures and process for determining whether there has been a commercial fishery failure as a result of a fishery resource disaster because of natural, man-made, or undetermined causes.</p> <p>Commerce shall have the sole authority to determine the existence, extent, and beginning and end dates of a fishery resource disaster. Additionally, Commerce must include in its budget justification materials submitted to Congress in support of the budget of Commerce for each fiscal year (as submitted with the President's budget) a separate statement of the amount requested to be appropriated for that fiscal year for outstanding unfunded fishery resource disasters.</p> <p>The title repeals a program that provides disaster relief assistance to fishermen, charter fishing operators, and others affected by a catastrophic regional fishery disaster, known as the regional coastal disaster assistance, transition, and recovery program.</p> <p>With respect to reporting requirements, the title requires (1) biennial rather than annual reports (under current law, annual reports) relating to the recovery of Klamath River Coho salmon, and (2) inclusion of additional information in the biennial reports on international compliance regarding the conservation of living marine resources.</p> <p>The title also repeals the requirement for annual reporting to Congress on bycatch reduction agreements.</p> <p>TITLE III--ALASKA SALMON RESEARCH TASK FORCE</p> <p><i>Alaska Salmon Research Task Force Act</i></p> <p>(Sec. 304) This title requires the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to convene an Alaska Salmon Research Task Force. The task force must review and report on research about the Pacific salmon in Alaska, identify applied research needed to better understand salmon migration and declining salmon returns in some regions of Alaska, and support sustainable management of salmon.</p> <p>TITLE IV--IUU TECHNICAL CORRECTIONS</p> <p>(Sec. 401) This title makes various technical corrections to the High Seas Driftnet Fishing Moratorium Protection Act.</p> <p>DIVISION T--SECURE 2.0 ACT OF 2022</p> <p><i>SECURE 2.0 Act of 2022</i></p> <p>TITLE I--EXPANDING COVERAGE AND INCREASING RETIREMENT SAVINGS</p> <p>This title makes various changes to expand incentives for employers to offer retirement plans, increase participation in employer-sponsored retirement plans, and increase the accumulation of savings in retirement plans. The changes impact private-sector defined contribution plans such as 401(k) plans, profit sharing and stock bonus plans, money purchase plans, and employee stock ownership plans; public sector or tax-exempt sector defined contribution plans such as 403(b) and 457(b) plans; and individual retirement accounts and annuities.</p> <p>(Sec. 101) This section generally requires new 401(k) and 403(b) retirement plans to automatically enroll eligible participants. The section includes exceptions for certain small businesses, new businesses, church plans, and governmental plans.</p> <p>(Sec. 102) This section increases the nonrefundable tax credits for small employers that start new retirement plans. First, it increases the credit from 50% to 100% of qualified start-up costs for employers with up to 50 employees. Second, it provides an additional credit based on a percentage of the employer's contribution to an employee's defined contribution retirement plan. The full credit, capped at $1,000 per employee, is available for employers with up to 50 employees. The credit phases out for employers with 51-100 employees.</p> <p>(Sec. 103) This section revises the nonrefundable tax credit for certain low- and middle-income taxpayers who contribute to certain qualified retirement accounts. Specifically, this section replaces the nonrefundable tax credit (commonly known as the saver's credit), with a federal government matching contribution to the taxpayer's individual retirement account (IRA) or retirement plan.</p> <p>(Sec. 104) This section requires the Department of the Treasury to promote public awareness of the federal government matching contribution.</p> <p>(Sec. 105) This section permits pooled employer plans (PEPs) to designate a named fiduciary (other than an employee of the plan) as the entity responsible for collecting contributions to the plan. Current law requires a PEP to designate a trustee to be responsible for collecting contributions and maintaining certain contribution-related policies and procedures. A PEP is a multiple employer retirement plan that allows unrelated employers to participate in a single defined contribution retirement plan.</p> <p>(Sec. 106) This section permits employers that sponsor 403(b) plans to participate in multiple employer plans (MEPs). A MEP is a plan maintained by two or more employers who are not related.</p> <p>(Sec. 107) This section increases the required minimum distribution (RMD) age from 72 to 75 in two steps over 10 years. The RMD age is the age at which a retirement plan participant or beneficiary must begin taking distributions. The RMD rules generally apply to participants and beneficiaries in IRAs (including traditional, SEP, and SIMPLE IRAs) and 401(k), 403(b), 457(b), profit sharing, and other defined contribution plans.</p> <p>(Sec. 108) This section indexes the catch-up contribution limit for individual retirement arrangements (IRAs) for individuals age 50 or older to inflation. Currently, the IRA catch-up contribution limit is $1,000 (not indexed).</p> <p>(Sec. 109) This section increases the annual limitation on catch-up contributions applicable to individuals ages 60, 61, 62, and 63. Generally, a catch-up contribution is an elective deferral by a retirement plan participant who is age 50 or older that exceeds a statutory limit, a plan-imposed limit, or the actual deferral percentage test limit for highly compensated employees.</p> <p>(Sec. 110) This section allows employer contributions on behalf of an employee for qualified student loan payments to be treated as employer matching contributions under 401(k), 403(b), SIMPLE IRAs, and governmental 457(b) plans.</p> <p>(Sec. 111) This section allows employers who join an existing pension plan (instead of establishing a separate plan) to take the tax credit for small employer pension plan start-up costs. This section is effective retroactively for taxable years beginning after December 13, 2019.</p> <p>(Sec. 112) This section provides a nonrefundable tax credit for small employers that make military-spouse employees eligible for participation in the employer's defined contribution retirement plan during the first two months of employment.</p> <p>(Sec. 113) This section permits employers to offer de minimis financial incentives (e.g., low-dollar gift cards) to encourage employee participation in the employer's 401(k) or 403(b) retirement plan. The section prohibits the use of plan assets to pay for the de minimis financial incentives.</p> <p>(Sec. 114) This section expands tax incentives for employee stock ownership plans (ESOPs) sponsored by S corporations. ESOPs are employer-sponsored defined contribution retirement plans that invest primarily in employer stock. Specifically, this section allows owners of stock in all non-publicly traded domestic corporations, including S corporations, to defer taxes on capital gains realized from selling their stock to an ESOP. Currently, the option to defer capital gains taxes is only available to owners of stock in a non-publicly traded C corporation who sell to an ESOP. Additionally, in the case of a sale of stock in an S corporation to an ESOP, the section limits the amount deferred to 10% of capital gains realized from the sale.</p> <p>(Sec. 115) This section allows certain penalty-free early withdrawals from tax-preferred retirement accounts for emergency personal expenses. Under current law, the Internal Revenue Code imposes an early withdrawal tax on distributions made from tax-preferred retirement accounts, such as IRAs and 401ks, before an individual attains age 59 1/2. The early withdrawal tax does not apply in some circumstances.</p> <p>(Sec. 116) This section increases the contribution an employer may make to a SIMPLE (Savings Incentive Match Plan for Employees) IRA or SIMPLE 401(k) plan. SIMPLE IRAs and SIMPLE 401(k) plans are simplified tax-advantaged retirement accounts often provided by small businesses.</p> <p>(Sec. 117) This section increases the annual limits for employee contributions and catch-up contributions to a SIMPLE IRA or SIMPLE 401(k) plan.</p> <p>(Sec. 118) This section exempts from the 10% excise tax on excess (nondeductible) contributions an employer's contributions to a simplified employee pension (SEP) IRA which are not deductible solely because they are not made in connection with a trade or business of the employer (e.g., contributions on behalf of a household employee). A SEP IRA is an employer-sponsored retirement plan where only the employer contributes to the plan and the employer contributes the same amount for each employee.</p> <p>(Sec. 119) This section removes the compensation-based limit on annual benefits under defined benefit plans for participants in rural electric cooperative plans who are not considered to be highly compensated employees.</p> <p>(Sec. 120) This section exempts from the tax on specified prohibited transactions the receipt of fees and compensation by an automatic portability provider in connection with an automatic transfer from an IRA established in connection with a distribution from a former employer's plan into an employer-sponsored defined contribution retirement plan in which the individual is an active participant. The transfer may only occur if the individual has been given advance notice of the transfer and has not affirmatively opted out of the transfer. </p> <p>Labor must issue guidance and studies related to the exemption. Treasury must issue a report on automatic distribution notices.</p> <p>(Sec. 121) This section creates two new types of plans--a starter 401(k) and a safe harbor 403(b)--for employers that do not offer a retirement plan. Among other features of these plans, employees generally enroll with a deferral rate between 3% and 15%. The limit on annual deferrals is $6,000 (indexed for inflation).</p> <p>(Sec. 122) This section requires Treasury to provide states with the contact information of owners of unredeemed savings bonds that are more than three years past their date of final maturity.</p> <p>(Sec. 123) This section revises the rules with respect to ESOPs to permit certain non-exchange traded securities to qualify as publicly traded employer securities if the security meets certain requirements.</p> <p>(Sec. 124) This section increases from 26 to 46 the age before which a qualifying disability must occur for an individual to be eligible for a tax-advantaged ABLE (Achieving Better Life Experience) account. ABLE accounts are designed to enable individuals with disabilities to save for and pay for disability-related expenses. To establish an account, an individual must have a qualifying impairment that began before the individual attained the age threshold.</p> <p>(Sec. 125) This section reduces from three years to two years the maximum period of consecutive part-time service an employer may require before an employee is eligible for participation in the employer's 401(k) plan. The section also applies this requirement and other coverage requirements for long-term, part-time workers to 403(b) plans that are subject to ERISA.</p> <p>(Sec. 126) This section permits certain rollovers from 529 college savings accounts to Roth IRAs without a tax penalty if the 529 account has been maintained for at least 15 years and certain other conditions are met.</p> <p>(Sec. 127) This section creates pension-linked emergency savings accounts, which are short-terms savings accounts established and maintained as part of an individual account plan (e.g., a 401(k) or other defined contribution plan). The section sets forth requirements and features of the emergency savings accounts, including a requirement that savings accounts are funded with after-tax Roth contributions.</p> <p>(Sec. 128) This section permits 403(b) plans with custodial accounts to invest in collective investment trusts for the purposes of tax law. (In order to permit 403(b) plans with custodial accounts to invest in collective investment trusts, certain modifications to securities laws will also be required.)</p> <p>TITLE II--PRESERVATION OF INCOME</p> <p>(Sec. 201) This section permits commercial annuities issued in connection with a defined contribution employer plan or an individual retirement account or annuity to satisfy RMD requirements even if the commercial annuities provide certain types of payments, such as annual payment increases of less than 5%, payments of dividends and distributions, and certain lump sum payments.</p> <p>(Sec. 202) This section directs Treasury to revise its regulations governing qualifying longevity annuity contracts (QLACs). QLACs generally are deferred annuities that begin payment at the end of an individual's life expectancy.</p> <p>Under the existing regulations, premiums paid for a qualifying QLAC cannot exceed both a dollar limitation ($145,000 for 2022) and a percentage limitation. This section repeals the requirement that premiums for QLACs be limited to 25% of an individual's account balance and permits the use of up to $200,000 (indexed for inflation) from an account balance to purchase a QLAC.</p> <p>The section also requires Treasury to make certain changes intended to facilitate the sale of QLACs with spousal survivor rights.</p> <p>(Sec. 203) This section directs Treasury to revise its rules to facilitate the use of exchange-traded funds as investment options in variable contracts (e.g., variable annuity life insurance policies). Exchange-traded funds are collective investment products registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission the shares of which, unlike mutual funds, are traded on a national stock exchange at market prices.</p> <p>(Sec. 204) This section directs Treasury to amend its RMD regulations to allow an employee who has an individual account in a defined contribution plan that is partially annuitized (i.e., that holds annuity contracts and other assets) to elect to calculate the RMD amount by aggregating the value of the annuities and the other portion of the account balance.</p> <p>TITLE III--SIMPLIFICATION AND CLARIFICATION OF RETIREMENT PLAN RULES</p> <p>This title modifies rules governing the design, implementation, and administration of retirement plans that qualify for preferred tax treatment (i.e., tax-qualified retirement plans) under the Internal Revenue Code (IRC).</p> <p>The title also makes changes to the regulation of employee benefit plans under the Employee Retirement Security Income Act of 1974 (ERISA). ERISA establishes minimum standards and requirements intended to protect plan participants and beneficiaries in most private sector employer-sponsored retirement and health plans.</p> <p>The title addresses issues such as error correction requirements, withdrawal and distribution rules, and notice and disclosure rules.</p> <p>(Sec. 301) This section establishes new rules applicable to inadvertent overpayments by plans under ERISA and the IRC. A fiduciary does not breach fiduciary duty for failing to recover an inadvertent overpayment. Also, a plan will not fail to be tax-qualified because it does not recover an inadvertent overpayment. The section sets forth applicable requirements and conditions.</p> <p>(Sec. 302) This section reduces the excise tax on a taxpayer who fails to satisfy the RMD requirements under a qualified retirement plan or 457(b) plan. Specifically, it reduces the excise tax from 50% to 25% of the amount by which the minimum required distribution exceeds the amount actually distributed and further reduces the excise tax to 10% for a taxpayer who corrects the error during a two-year correction window.</p> <p>(Sec. 303) This section directs Labor to establish an online searchable database&#8212;the Retirement Savings Lost and Found&#8212;to allow individuals to search for information and locate the administrator of various plans.</p> <p>(Sec. 304) This section raises the cap from $5,000 to $7,000 on the amount of vested accrued benefits that a qualified retirement plan may involuntarily distribute to an IRA (or cash out if under $1,000), such as when a job change occurs.</p> <p>(Sec. 305) This section expands the Employee Plans Compliance Resolution System (EPCRS) to allow any eligible inadvertent failure to comply with rules under specified sections of the IRC to be self-corrected under the EPCRS, unless the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) identifies the error first or the self-correction was not completed in a reasonable time. The term <i>eligible inadvertent failure </i>means a failure that occurs despite the existence of practices and procedures that satisfy IRS standards or similar standards in the case of an individual retirement plan.</p> <p>The section also directs the IRS to expand the EPCRS to allow (1) custodians of individual retirement accounts and annuities to address eligible inadvertent failures, including waivers of the excise tax that would otherwise apply; and (2) certain eligible inadvertent failures related to a loan from a plan to be self-corrected.</p> <p>(Sec. 306) This section allows participants in governmental 457(b) plans to change their deferral rate at any time before the compensation is available (instead of prior to the beginning of the month in which the deferral will be made).</p> <p>(Sec. 307) This section expands the tax deduction for qualified charitable distributions (QCDs). A <i>QCD </i>is a nontaxable distribution by a taxpayer aged 70 1/2 or older transferred directly from a traditional or Roth IRA to a charitable organization. Currently, the maximum annual exclusion is $100,000 (not indexed). This section indexes the $100,000 maximum annual exclusion to inflation.

Currently, an employer-sponsored defined contribution plan that is top heavy (i.e., more than 60% of the aggregate accrued benefits or account balances are for certain key employees) must satisfy certain minimum vesting and minimum benefit requirements to maintain its tax-qualified status. This section allows the plan to exclude employees who do not meet the minimum age or service requirements in determining whether the plan satisfies minimum vesting and minimum benefit requirements.</p> <p>(Sec. 311) This section restricts to three years the period during which a qualified birth or adoption distribution may be repaid to a retirement plan. Current law allows an individual to take a penalty-free early distribution from certain defined contribution retirement plans of up to $5,000 for a qualified birth or adoption.</p> <p>(Sec. 312) This section allows 401(k) and 403(b) plans to rely on an employee's written self-certification that a deemed hardship distribution is due to an immediate and heavy financial need and is limited to the amount required to satisfy that financial need.

Specifically, the section provides that ongoing plan disclosures are not required to be provided to unenrolled participants so long as the unenrolled participants are provided with an annual reminder of their eligibility to participate in the plan and any documents they request.</p> <p>(Sec. 321) This section directs Labor to review its interpretive bulletin related to the fiduciary standards when selecting an annuity provider for a defined benefit pension plan and consult with the ERISA advisory council to determine if changes are needed. It also requires Labor to report on its findings, including an assessment of any risk to participants.</p> <p>(Sec. 322) This section modifies the tax treatment of certain IRAs involved in a prohibited transaction (e.g., a transaction where an IRA buys investment property from the IRA owner). Currently, if there is a prohibited transaction in an IRA, the IRA loses its tax-favored status and the fair market value of the assets in the entire IRA are treated as distributed to the owner. This section specifies that if an individual has multiple IRAs, they are treated separately with respect to prohibited transactions.</p> <p>(Sec. 323) This section specifies that the exemption from the 10% additional tax on early withdrawals from retirement plans for distributions that are substantially equal periodic payments made over the account owner's life expectancy applies in the case of a rollover of the account, an exchange of the annuity providing the payments, or an annuity that meets the RMD requirements.</p> <p>(Sec. 324) This section directs Treasury to develop and issue guidance in the form of sample forms to simplify, standardize, facilitate, and expedite the completion of rollovers to eligible retirement plans and trustee-to-trustee transfers from an IRA to another individual retirement account or annuity.</p> <p>(Sec. 325) This section exempts designated Roth accounts that are included in employer-sponsored retirement plans from the RMD rules prior to the participant's death.</p> <p>(Sec. 326) This section allows penalty-free early distributions from retirement plans for individuals who have a terminal illness.</p> <p>(Sec. 327) This section permits surviving spouses to elect to be treated as the deceased employee for purposes of the RMD requirements.</p> <p>(Sec. 328) This section eliminates the requirement that certain distributions from a governmental retirement plan for the health or long-term care insurance premiums of a retired public safety officer must be paid directly to the insurance plan for such amount to be excluded from the retired officer's gross income.</p> <p>(Sec. 329) This section exempts from the 10% additional tax on early withdrawals distributions under a governmental plan to public safety employees with at least 25 years of service under the plan, regardless of their age.</p> <p>(Sec. 330) This section extends the public safety employee exception to the 10% additional tax on early withdrawals to distributions under a governmental plan to corrections officers and certain forensic security employees.</p> <p>(Sec. 331) This section allows penalty-free early withdrawals from retirement plans in connection with a federally declared disaster. It permits distributions of up to $22,000 per participant, per disaster.</p> <p>(Sec. 332) This section permits an employer to replace a SIMPLE IRA plan with a safe harbor 401(k) plan at any time during the year. The section also provides a waiver of certain rollover rules for a conversion of a SIMPLE IRA to a 401(k) plan or 403(b) plan.</p> <p>(Sec. 333) This section allows penalty-free early withdrawals from an IRA of any excess contribution amount (and associated earnings) included in a corrective distribution.</p> <p>(Sec. 334) This section permits employer-sponsored defined contribution retirement plans to make penalty-free distributions of up to $2,500 per year (inflation adjusted) to pay the premiums for long-term care insurance that meets certain standards.</p> <p>(Sec. 335) This section directs Treasury to revise its minimum funding regulations for defined benefit plans to limit the mortality improvement rate that is used to calculate the present value of a stream of expected future benefit payments.</p> <p>(Sec. 336) This section requires the Government Accountability Office to report on the effectiveness of notices provided by plans to participants about distributions eligible for rollover treatment.</p> <p>(Sec. 337) This section modifies the RMD rules for special needs trusts, including by allowing the special needs trust to provide for a charitable organization as the remainder beneficiary.</p> <p>(Sec. 338) This section requires a certain number of periodic benefit statements to be provided in paper form.

Currently, the regulation requires plan administrators to disclose certain plan and investment-related information, including fee and expense information, to participants and beneficiaries. This section requires Labor to explore improvements to enhance participants' understanding of fees and expenses related to a defined contribution plan under ERISA, as well as the cumulative effect of the fees and expenses on retirement savings over time.</p> <p>(Sec. 341) This section directs Labor and Treasury to adopt regulations providing that a plan can consolidate certain required notices.</p> <p>(Sec. 342) This section requires a pension plan administrator that is amending the plan in order to provide participants with the option to elect a lump sum payment to provide the participants with certain information about the available benefit options, including an explanation about how the lump sum was calculated.</p> <p>(Sec. 343) This section modifies requirements regarding the annual funding notices for a defined benefit plan, including by requiring the plan to provide the average return on assets for the plan year.</p> <p>(Sec. 344) This section requires Labor to report on the pooled employer plan (PEP) industry.

For such an application, the FDA shall also allow the application to rely on or reference data and information concerning the technology's use in the manufacturing of other drugs.</p> <p>Chapter 2--Transparency, Program Integrity, and Regulatory Improvements</p> <p>(Sec. 3221) This section modifies the FDA's authority to impose safe disposal requirements as part of a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy for a drug.</p> <p>Currently, the FDA may require that a drug be dispensed with a safe disposal packaging or safe disposal system that renders the drug nonretrievable. Under this section, the FDA may impose such safe disposal requirements without regard to whether the drug is rendered nonretrievable.</p> <p>(Sec. 3222) This section requires the FDA to provide a therapeutic equivalence rating for certain new drug applications if a request is made in the application.</p> <p>Generally, this requirement shall apply to an application for a new prescription drug (1) that relies on information from studies not conducted by the applicant and that the applicant does not have a right to reference or use (commonly referred to as a 505(b)(2) application), and (2) where the only differences between the new drug and a listed drug are certain differences involving inactive ingredients.</p> <p>A drug is a therapeutic equivalent of another if they produce the same clinical effect and have the same safety profile. Typically, for certain generic drugs, the FDA rates the therapeutic equivalence of that generic drug to another drug, such as the brand name version. Currently, an applicant seeking approval of a drug through a 505(b)(2) application typically only receives an equivalence rating by requesting one from the FDA in a separate petition.</p> <p>This section also imposes deadlines for the FDA to provide a requested therapeutic equivalence rating.</p> <p>(Sec. 3223) This section requires the FDA to solicit comments about the factors that the FDA should consider when reviewing requests by drug manufacturers to change the third-party vendors engaged to help implement and manage risk evaluation and mitigation strategies. The GAO must report to Congress on such vendor changes and any issues involving patient access to the drug that stemmed from such a change.</p> <p>(Sec. 3224) This section revises the requirements for a provision that allows a generic drug seeking FDA approval to have different labeling from the listed version of the drug, including deadlines for the sponsor of the generic drug to agree to revise the labeling.</p> <p>Subtitle C--Medical Devices</p> <p>(Sec. 3301) This section authorizes the manufacturer of certain medical devices with an emergency use authorization to submit a single submission to the FDA to request both (1) a medical device classification, and (2) a determination that the device uses a simple laboratory examination or procedure approved for home use that poses an insignificant risk of an erroneous result.</p> <p>Specifically, a manufacturer may use this single submission procedure if the FDA, when granting an emergency use authorization, determined that the device uses such a simple examination or procedure.</p> <p>(Sec. 3302) This section requires the FDA to convene at least one panel of the Medical Devices Advisory Committee each year to provide advice to the FDA concerning medical devices used in pandemic preparedness and response.</p> <p>(Sec. 3303) This section requires the GAO to report to Congress on an existing FDA program for third-party reviewers to provide recommendations relating to the classification of medical devices, including an audit of the performance of such reviewers.</p> <p>(Sec. 3304) This section modifies requirements related to certificates to foreign governments (an export certificate that certifies that a medical device marketed in the United States meets various legal and regulatory requirements).</p> <p>(Sec. 3305) This section requires an applicant submitting certain applications to the FDA pertaining to a medical device, such as a request for a classification of the medical device, to take certain actions if the medical device qualifies as a cyber device.</p> <p>Under this section, a cyber device is generally a medical device with software that connects to the internet and contains technical characteristics that could be vulnerable to cybersecurity threats.</p> <p>The applicant for such a device must (1) submit to the FDA a plan to monitor and address postmarket cybersecurity vulnerabilities and exploits, (2) develop and maintain processes and procedures to provide reasonable reassurance that the device is secure from cybersecurity threats, (3) make available patches and updates for the device to address cybersecurity threats, and (4) comply with any related requirements the FDA may require through regulation.</p> <p>This section prohibits selling cyber devices that fail to meet such requirements.</p> <p>The GAO shall report on the cybersecurity challenges facing medical devices, including legacy devices that may not support certain software security updates.</p> <p>(Sec. 3306) This section authorizes the FDA to ban specific intended uses of a medical device if that use presents an unreasonable or substantial injury risk. (In 2021, a federal appeals court ruled that the current statute, which authorizes the FDA to ban a medical device for posing such a risk, does not authorize the FDA to ban only specific uses of a device.)</p> <p>(Sec. 3307) This section requires the FDA to take certain actions if it makes a decision related to a medical device based on information provided by an FDA-funded third party. For example, if the FDA relies on data, analytical code, results, or other information from such third parties to support a regulatory decision, the FDA must provide, to the extent possible, a summary of such information to the manufacturers impacted by that decision.</p> <p>(Sec. 3308) This section waives certain requirements for medical device manufacturers making changes to a device if the changes are consistent with an FDA-approved predetermined change control plan.</p> <p>Generally, a predetermined change control plan describes planned changes that may be made to a medical device, where the device would remain safe and effective even if the change was not made.</p> <p>If a manufacturer makes a change that is consistent with an FDA-approved plan to a device that has received premarket approval, the manufacturer shall not be required to file a supplemental application, even if such a change would otherwise require a supplemental application.</p> <p>If a manufacturer makes a change that is consistent with an FDA-approved plan to a device that has been cleared by the FDA, the manufacturer shall not be required to make a premarket notification.</p> <p>(Sec. 3309) This section authorizes the FDA to waive the annual establishment registration fee for small businesses after the initial registration fee. For the purpose of this waiver, a small business is generally one that reported $1 million or less in gross receipts or sales in its most recent federal tax return. (Generally, establishments involved in the production and distribution of medical devices for U.S. commercial distribution are required to register annually with the FDA and pay a fee with each registration.)</p> <p>Subtitle D--Infant Formula</p> <p>(Sec. 3401) This section addresses shortages in critical foods (i.e., infant formula and medical foods).</p> <p>A manufacturer of a critical food must notify the FDA of a permanent discontinuance or interruption in the manufacture of the critical food that is likely to lead to a meaningful disruption of the food's supply in the United States. If the FDA determines that a shortage of the critical food is likely to result, the FDA must provide the Department of Agriculture (USDA) certain information about the shortage.</p> <p>After providing such information to USDA about an infant formula shortage, the FDA must shorten the premarket registration requirement for marketing a new infant formula to 30 days before marketing a new infant formula, whereas typically an entity must register at least 90 days before marketing a new formula. The FDA shall use this shortened premarket registration requirement for a period of at least 90 days, or as long as appropriate to prevent or mitigate an infant formula shortage.</p> <p>The FDA must also respond to certain manufacturer submissions required for infant formula within 45 days of receiving the submission, whereas currently there is no statutory deadline for such responses.</p> <p>If there is a shortage of specialty infant formula (generally a formula for infants with an unusual medical or dietary problem, such as low birth weight), the FDA may waive statutory requirements to facilitate the importation of such specialty formula.</p> <p>This section also authorizes individuals to import up to a three-month supply of infant formula for personal use from Canada, the European Union, or any country that is implementing and enforcing formula safety and nutritional adequacy requirements that are similar to U.S. requirements.</p> <p>This section also imposes requirements related to infant formula recalls, such as requiring (1) a manufacturer of a recalled infant formula to provide certain information and plans to the FDA, (2) the FDA to provide a list of required actions after an inspection of a manufacturing facility impacted by a recall, and (3) the FDA to notify Congress within 24 hours of initiating a recall.</p> <p>The FDA must conduct annual inspections of infant formula manufacturing facilities. To meet this requirement, the FDA may rely on inspections conducted by foreign regulatory authorities and state agencies, as appropriate.</p> <p>The FDA must also establish the Office of Critical Foods, which shall be responsible for oversight, coordination, and facilitation of activities related to critical foods.</p> <p>Furthermore, the FDA must (1) develop and issue a national strategy on infant formula to increase the resiliency of the infant formula supply chain, (2) publish on its website information on how to identify appropriate substitutes for infant formula that are relied upon by infants and other individuals with serious health conditions, and (3) meet with representatives from other countries to discuss ways to harmonize regulatory requirements for infant formula.</p> <p>Subtitle E--Cosmetics</p> <p><i>Modernization of Cosmetics Regulation Act of 2022</i></p> <p>This subtitle requires cosmetics brands and manufacturer s (referred to as responsible persons) to register with the F DA, provides the FDA with various regulatory authorities, and addresses related issues.</p> <p>(Sec. 3502) The FDA must establish by regul ation good manufacturing practices designed to protect public health and ensure that cosmetics products are not adulterated.</p> <p>Responsible persons must register with the FDA their manufacturing and processing facilities. Each registration must contain certain information, such as the facility's address, contact information, and the brands of the cosmetics manufactured or processed at the facility.</p> <p>The FDA may suspend a facility registration for various reasons, including if the registrant's product has a reasonable probability of causing serious adverse health consequences and the problem cannot be isolated to certain products. The section establishes certain requirements pertaining to such suspensions, such as requiring (1) the FDA to provide the registrant with an opportunity for an informal hearing no later than five days after issuing the suspension, and (2) the registrant to submit a corrective action plan if the suspension remains in place after the hearing.</p> <p>This section also requires responsible persons to register with the FDA each cosmetic product every year. Each registration must contain certain information, such as the registration number of each manufacturing or processing facility and a list of ingredients.</p> <p>Each responsible person for a cosmetic product must maintain records (e.g., tests and studies) that support a reasonable certainty that the product is safe. Coal-tar hair dye shall be subject to different requirements.</p> <p>If a responsible person receives a report of a serious adverse event (generally an event resulting in death, hospitalization, or other health problems) involving a cosmetic product in the United States, the responsible person must submit the report to the FDA no later than 15 days after initially receiving the report. A responsible person must also maintain certain records related to such reports.</p> <p>The section also imposes certain labeling requirements for cosmetic products, such as requiring (1) labels to identify any fragrance allergens in a product, and (2) products intended only for professional use to contain a clear and prominent statement saying that the product is intended only for use by licensed professionals.</p> <p>Furthermore, the FDA may order a mandatory recall of a cosmetic product where there is a reasonable possibility that the product fails to meet certain regulatory requirements and the use of the product will cause serious adverse health consequences. The subtitle imposes various requirements related to such authorities, such as requiring the FDA to give the responsible person subject to the recall (1) an opportunity to voluntarily recall the product or cease distribution, and (2) an opportunity for an informal hearing no later than 10 days after the order.</p> <p>(Sec. 3503) This section prohibits the sale of products that fail to meet certain requirements established by this subtitle, such as the registration requirements, with certain exceptions.</p> <p>(Sec. 3504) The FDA is authorized to inspect various records related to the requirements established by this subtitle.</p> <p>(Sec. 3505) The FDA must establish regulations to require standardized testing methods for detecting asbestos in talc-containing cosmetics products.</p> <p>(Sec. 3506) The FDA must assess the safety of using of perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, commonly referred to as PFAS, in cosmetic products.</p> <p>Subtitle F--Cross-Cutting Provisions</p> <p>Chapter 1--Clinical Trial Diversity and Modernization</p> <p>This chapter addresses issues related to clinical trials, including the diversity of clinical trial populations.</p> <p>(Sec. 3601) The chapter requires certain clinical studies related to an application for a new drug or medical device to include a diversity action plan. Such a plan shall include (1) goals for enrollment in the study, (2) the rationale for such goals, and (3) an explanation of how the applicant intends to meet those goals.</p> <p>(Sec. 3602) The FDA must issue or revise guidance relating to such diversity action plans.</p> <p>(Sec. 3603) The FDA must solicit input on increasing the enrollment of historically underrepresented populations in clinical studies.</p> <p>(Sec. 3605) This section requires the FDA to convene a public meeting to discuss FDA recommendations provided during the COVID-19 emergency period on mitigating disruption to clinical studies, including how such recommendations can be used to improve diversity in the patient populations in clinical studies.</p> <p>(Sec. 3606) The FDA must issue or revise draft guidance with recommendations related to using decentralized clinical studies to support the development of drugs and devices, including how decentralized trials can help improve the diversity of the clinical trial population.</p> <p>(Sec. 3607) The FDA must issue or revise draft guidance (1) on using digital health technologies to help improve recruitment and participation in clinical trials; and (2) on the use of seamless, concurrent, and other innovative clinical trial designs to support the expedited development and review of drugs.</p> <p>The FDA must also, as appropriate, work with foreign regulators to facilitate international harmonization on the regulation of decentralized clinical trials and innovative clinical trial designs.</p> <p>Chapter 2--Inspections</p> <p>This chapter addresses the FDA's authority to conduct inspections.</p> <p>(Sec. 3611) Currently, the FDA has expanded inspection authority for facilities that manufacture or process restricted medical devices, which are devices subject to heightened FDA regulations, such as those that may only be used or sold with authorization by a licensed medical practitioner. Under this section, the FDA shall have this expanded inspection authority even for facilities that only handle medical devices that are not restricted.</p> <p>(Sec. 3612) This section states that the FDA has the authority, subject to various requirements, to enter certain sites to inspect records to ensure the accuracy and reliability of studies and records and to assess compliance with legal requirements.</p> <p>(Sec. 3613) For the purposes of conducting risk-based inspections of establishments in foreign countries, the FDA shall consider, in addition to other factors, the compliance history of establishments in the country or region where the establishment is located. The FDA must also periodically assess, for the purposes of inspecting foreign establishments, whether additional arrangements or agreements with a foreign government are appropriate.</p> <p>(Sec. 3614) The GAO must report to Congress on inspections of foreign establishments conducted by the FDA and by foreign governments.</p> <p>(Sec. 3615) This section establishes a pilot program to increase unannounced surveillance inspections of foreign human drug establishments. The FDA shall evaluate the differences between such inspections on foreign and domestic establishments.</p> <p>Chapter 3--Miscellaneous</p> <p>(Sec. 3621) This section requires the FDA to regulate any contrast agent, radioactive drug, or over-the-counter (OTC) monograph drug as a drug and not a medical device. (Generally, an OTC monograph drug is a nonprescription drug without an approved FDA application where the drug must meet the requirements set out in a document known as a monograph.)</p> <p>For a product that is now regulated as a drug under this section but was legally marketed as a medical device on September 30, 2022, the FDA shall waive certain application fees.</p> <p>(Sec. 3622) This section requires the FDA's Office of Women's Health to review and update if necessary the Women's Health Research Roadmap and brief Congress on the review.</p> <p>(Sec. 3623) This section requires the FDA to develop and begin the implementation of a strategic workforce plan to recruit, train, and retain the workforce needed to support the FDA's public health mission.</p> <p>(Sec. 3624) This section authorizes the FDA to use certain enhanced hiring authorities to hire outstanding and qualified candidates in scientific, technical, and professional positions to support the regulation of food and cosmetics.</p> <p>(Sec. 3625) This section modifies various FDA fees, including fees relating to new drug applications and biosimilar applications.</p> <p>(Sec. 3626) This section revises requirements related to the reauthorization of FDA fees.</p> <p>(Sec. 3627) This section requires the FDA to periodically report to Congress a coordinated strategic plan to modernize the FDA's information technology systems.

(Similar authorities were in effect during 2022 under a nationwide waiver that was issued by USDA.)</p> <p>Additionally, the section directs USDA to establish a permanent, nationwide summer electronic benefit transfer (Summer EBT) program beginning in the summer of 2024 to provide nutrition assistance benefits at a rate of $40 per eligible child per month during the summer. The amount may be proportionately higher, consistent with certain adjustments that have been established to reflect the higher costs of providing meals in certain states and territories. The amount must also be adjusted annually for inflation after 2024. USDA must also make payments to states that are equal to 50% of the administrative costs incurred by the states in operating Summer EBT.</p> <p>This section also modifies the Pandemic EBT (P-EBT) program to prohibit states from providing P-EBT benefits in the summer of 2023 to children who did not attend a school at the end of the 2022-2023 school year that participated in the National School Lunch Program or the School Breakfast Program (e.g., children who were homeschooled or enrolled in fully virtual institutions).</p> <p>(Sec. 503) This section reduces certain nutrition assistance benefits that were provided in response to COVID-19, including by (1) limiting P-EBT benefits in summer 2023 to $120 per child, and (2) ending SNAP emergency allotments after February 2023.</p> <p>TITLE V--OTHER MATTERS</p> <p>(Sec. 601) This section directs USDA to make pandemic assistance payments to cotton merchandisers that purchased cotton from a U.S. cotton producer or marketed cotton on behalf of a U.S. cotton producer between March 1, 2020, and the enactment of this act.</p> <p>(Sec. 602) This section directs USDA to make a one-time payment to each rice producer on a farm in the United States with respect to the 2022 crop year.</p> <p>(Sec. 603) This section specifies that the provisions of H.R. 5608 (Chronic Wasting Disease Research and Management Act) of the 117th Congress, are hereby enacted into law.

Inhofe National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2023. </p> <p>TITLE III--IMMIGRATION EXTENSIONS </p> <p>(Sec. 301) This section extends through FY2023 the authorization for the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services E-Verify Program. (E-Verify is an internet-based system that allows businesses to determine the eligibility of their employees to work in the United States.) </p> <p>(Sec. 302) This section extends through FY2023 the special immigrant program for non-minister religious workers. (The program allows non-ministers in religious vocations and occupations to immigrate to or adjust status in the United States for the purpose of performing religious work in a full-time compensated position.) </p> <p>(Sec. 303) This section extends through FY2023 the authority of DHS to increase the numerical limitation on the number of aliens that that are permitted to enter the United States under the H-2B visa program for temporary nonagricultural labor. It also specifies that the limit may not exceed the highest number of H-2B nonimmigrants who participated in the H-2B returning worker program in any year in which returning workers were exempt from the numerical limitation. </p> <p>(Sec. 304) This section extends through FY2023 the authority under the Conrad State Program (also known as the Conrad 30 Program) to waive the two-year home country physical presence requirement for foreign medical graduates who have expiring J-1 visas, apply to remain in the United States, and commit to working in medically underserved areas for at least three years. </p> <p>TITLE IV--ENVIRONMENT AND PUBLIC WORKS MATTERS</p> <p> (Sec. 401) This section establishes a federal regional commission for the Great Lakes region. (Federal regional commissions are congressionally chartered, federal-state partnerships that seek to address economic distress in their designated regions.) </p> <p>For the purposes of the commission, the Great Lakes region includes areas in the watershed of the Great Lakes and the Great Lakes System in Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. </p> <p>(Sec. 402) This section reauthorizes through FY2027 various U.S. Fish and Wildlife authorities and programs related to the acceptance of gifts, volunteer services, community partnerships, and refuge education programs. </p> <p>(Sec. 404) This section renames the Lake Champlain Basin Program as the Patrick Leahy Lake Champlain Basin Program.

The temporary order expires on December 31, 2022. </p> <p>TITLE VII--FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION OVERSIGHT OF HORSERACING INTEGRITY AND SAFETY AUTHORITY </p> <p>(Sec. 701) This section expands the authority of the Federal Trade Commission to oversee the Horseracing Integrity and Safety Authority by abrogating, adding to, and modifying the rules issued by the authority. (In a November 2022 decision, The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit held that the law that created the authority is unconstitutional because Congress impermissibly delegated the powers of the FTC to the private Horseracing Integrity and Safety Authority by giving the FTC only limited powers to review the authority's rules.) </p> <p>TITLE VIII--UNITED STATES PAROLE COMMISSION EXTENSION </p> <p><i>United States Parole Commission Additional Extension Act of 2022 </i></p> <p>(Sec. 801) This section extends the U.S. Parole Commission. </p> <p>TITLE IX--EXTENSION OF FCC AUCTION AUTHORITY </p> <p>(Sec. 901) This section extends the authority of the Federal Communications Commission to conduct auctions for electromagnetic spectrum licenses through March 9. 2023. </p> <p>TITLE X--BUDGETARY EFFECTS </p> <p>(Sec. 1001) This section exempts the budgetary effects of this division and each succeeding division from (1) the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010 (PAYGO Act), (2) the Senate PAYGO rule, and (3) certain budget scorekeeping rules. </p> <p>This section also requires certain debits on the FY2023 and FY2024 scorecards maintained under the PAYGO Act to be transferred to the FY2025 scorecards. </p> <p>(The PAYGO Act generally prohibits direct spending and revenue legislation from increasing the budget deficit. PAYGO scorecards are used to enforce the requirements and determine whether a sequestration order implementing spending cuts is necessary.) </p> <p>DIVISION P--ELECTORAL COUNT REFORM AND PRESIDENTIAL TRANSITION IMPROVEMENT</p> <p><i>Electoral Count Reform and Presidential Transition Improvement Act of 2022</i></p> <p>TITLE I--ELECTORAL COUNT REFORM ACT</p> <p><i>Electoral Count Reform Act of 2022</i></p> <p>(Sec. 102) This section specifies that the choice of electors must occur in accordance with the laws of the state enacted prior to election day.</p> <p>(Sec. 103) This section specifies that states may fill vacancies in the electoral college in accordance with the laws of the state enacted prior to election day.</p> <p>(Sec. 104) This section identifies each state's governor (unless otherwise identified in the laws or constitution of a state in effect on election day) as responsible for submitting the certificate of ascertainment identifying the state's electors. It also provides for expedited judicial review for any action brought by an aggrieved presidential or vice-presidential candidate arising under the U.S. Constitution or U.S. laws with respect to the issuance or transmission of such a certificate.</p> <p>(Sec. 105) This section specifies the duties of the Archivist of the United States as it relates to the certificate of ascertainment of appointment of electors.</p> <p>(Sec. 106) This section changes when the electors of each state must meet to cast their votes for President and Vice President. Specifically, the electors must meet and give their votes on the first Tuesday (previously, Monday) after the second Wednesday in December. Additionally, the meeting place in each state must be designated prior to election day in accordance with the laws of the state.</p> <p>(Sec. 107) This section revises the process for the transmission of certificates of votes. In particular, the electors must immediately transfer at the same time and by the most expeditious method available the certificates of votes with the annexed certificates of ascertainment of appointment of electors.</p> <p>(Sec. 108) This section requires the President of the Senate or the Archivist of the United States to request, in the event of a failure to receive a certificate of electoral vote by a certain time, that the chief election officer transmit one of the copies they hold to the President of the Senate by the most expeditious method available. (Previously, the secretary of state had to transmit a copy by registered mail.) It also removes the penalty for a messenger's neglect of duty.</p> <p>(Sec. 109) This section revises the framework for the joint session of Congress to count electoral votes and make a formal declaration of which candidates have been elected President and Vice President. In particular, the section (1) specifies that the role of the President of the Senate during the joint session shall be ministerial in nature, and (2) raises the objection threshold in Congress to at least one-fifth of the duly chosen and sworn members of both the House of Representatives and the Senate.</p> <p>(Sec. 110) This section revises the procedure for joint session challenges to electoral vote returns by (1) requiring all objections and questions permitted with respect to the state to be considered during that time, and (2) requiring the presiding officer of each chamber to put each of the objections and questions to a vote without further debate.</p> <p>TITLE II--PRESIDENTIAL TRANSITION IMPROVEMENT ACT</p> <p><i>Presidential Transition Improvement Act</i></p> <p>(Sec. 202) This section revises provisions related to the presidential transition process. In particular, the section (1) allows more than one candidate to receive federal transition resources under certain circumstances, and (2) requires additional reporting by the General Services Administration.</p> <p>DIVISION Q--AVIATION RELATED MATTERS</p> <p>(Sec. 101) This section establishes a pilot grant program to support advanced air mobility (AAM) infrastructure. AAM infrastructure refers to an air transportation system that transports individuals and property between points in the United States in both controlled and uncontrolled airspace using certain aircraft, including remotely piloted, autonomous, or vertical take-off and landing aircraft.</p> <p>The Department of Transportation (DOT) must award planning grants for AAM infrastructure to (1) state, local, or tribal governments; (2) airport sponsors; (3) transit agencies; (4) port authorities; (5) metropolitan planning organizations; or (6) consortia of such entities. Entities that receive these grants must develop a comprehensive plan for AAM infrastructure, including vertiports (sites that support the landing, takeoff, loading, and other operations of AAM aircraft). Topics covered in the plan must address matters such as identifying locations for AAM infrastructure and available sources of funding. DOT must brief Congress about the plans it receives. The briefing must include an evaluation of the planned or proposed locations for vertiports and a description of best practices or lessons learned through the review of comprehensive plans.</p> <p>Grants may not be awarded after September 30, 2024.</p> <p><i>Samya Rose Stumo National Air Grant Fellowship Program Act of 2022</i></p> <p>(Sec. 102) This section commemorates the lives lost as a result of Boeing 737 MAX 8 airplane crashes.</p> <p>In particular, the section changes the name of the National Air Grant Fellowship Program to the Samya Rose Stumo National Air Grant Fellowship Program in honor of a public health advocate who died in one of the crashes. (The fellowship provides graduate students in aerospace engineering and related fields with aviation policy experience.)</p> <p>(Sec. 103) This section authorizes DOT to provide temporary insurance for air carriers with terminated war risk liability coverage.</p> <p>(Sec. 104) This section eliminates a restriction on retired or former officers of the Armed Forces serving as the Deputy Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration.</p> <p>(Sec. 105) This section directs DOT to develop a national aviation preparedness plan for communicable disease outbreaks, including to (1) create a process to identify appropriate personal protective equipment for individuals such as flight attendants to reduce the likelihood of exposure to a communicable disease that has the potential to cause an epidemic or pandemic of infectious disease that would constitute a public health emergency of international concern (i.e., a covered communicable disease); and (2) improve coordination between airports, air carriers, and governmental entities with respect to preparing for and responding to communicable disease outbreaks.</p> <p>In developing the plan, DOT must consult with aviation industry and labor stakeholders such as air carriers.</p> <p>The Government Accountability Office must conduct a study assessing the plan, including (1) whether the plan meets the obligations of the United States under international conventions and treaties, and (2) the extent to which the U.S. aviation system is prepared to respond to an outbreak of a covered communicable disease.</p> <p>(Sec. 106) This section directs DOT to establish an Aerospace Supply Chain Resiliency Task Force to identify and assess risks to the U.S. aerospace supply chain and identify best practices and make recommendations to mitigate such risks.</p> <p>The task force must convene for an initial meeting within 120 days after enactment of this act and at least every 90 days thereafter. It must also report to Congress on the activities it carries out, including recommendations for regulatory, policy, or legislative action to improve government efforts to reduce barriers, mitigate risk, and bolster the resiliency of the U.S. aerospace supply chain.</p> <p>The task force shall terminate upon submission of the report to Congress.</p> <p>(Sec. 107) This section revises the age standards for pilots to allow air carriers that meet certain criteria to employ pilots until they are 70 years of age.</p> <p>DIVISION R--NO TIKTOK ON GOVERNMENT DEVICES</p> <p><i>No TikTok on Government Devices Act</i></p> <p>(Sec. 102) This section requires the social media video application TikTok to be removed from the information technology of federal agencies.</p> <p>Specifically, it requires the Office of Management and Budget to develop standards for executive agencies that require TikTok and any successor application from the developer to be removed from agency information technology (e.g., devices). Such standards must include exceptions for law enforcement activities, national security interests, and security researchers.</p> <p>DIVISION S--OCEANS RELATED MATTERS</p> <p>TITLE I--DRIFTNET MODERNIZATION</p> <p><i>Driftnet Modernization and Bycatch Reduction Act</i></p> <p>This title addresses certain driftnet fishing. Driftnet fishing is a method of fishing in which a gillnet composed of a panel or panels of webbing, or a series of such gillnets, is placed in the water and allowed to drift with the currents and winds for the purpose of entangling fish in the webbing.</p> <p>(Sec. 102) Currently, the use of large-scale drift gillnets with a total length of 2.5 kilometers or more is prohibited in the United States. This section expands the definition of large-scale driftnet fishing to prohibit the use of gillnets with a mesh size of 14 inches or greater. This expanded prohibition does not apply within the U.S. exclusive economic zone for five years.</p> <p>(Sec. 104) The Department of Commerce must conduct a transition program to facilitate the phase out of large-scale driftnet fishing and to promote the adoption of alternative fishing practices that minimize the incidental catch of living marine resources.</p> <p>Commerce must award grants to program participants.</p> <p>(Sec. 106) The North Pacific Fishery Management Council may recommend and Commerce may approve regulations that require charter operators to pay fees on vessels that harvest Pacific halibut in specific International Pacific Halibut Commission regulatory areas.</p> <p>TITLE II--FISHERY RESOURCE DISASTERS IMPROVEMENT</p> <p><i>Fishery Resource Disasters Improvement Act</i></p> <p>This title revises the Fisheries Resource Disaster Relief Program and repeals or revises certain reporting requirements.</p> <p>The title revises the procedures and process for determining whether there has been a commercial fishery failure as a result of a fishery resource disaster because of natural, man-made, or undetermined causes.</p> <p>Commerce shall have the sole authority to determine the existence, extent, and beginning and end dates of a fishery resource disaster. Additionally, Commerce must include in its budget justification materials submitted to Congress in support of the budget of Commerce for each fiscal year (as submitted with the President's budget) a separate statement of the amount requested to be appropriated for that fiscal year for outstanding unfunded fishery resource disasters.</p> <p>The title repeals a program that provides disaster relief assistance to fishermen, charter fishing operators, and others affected by a catastrophic regional fishery disaster, known as the regional coastal disaster assistance, transition, and recovery program.</p> <p>With respect to reporting requirements, the title requires (1) biennial rather than annual reports (under current law, annual reports) relating to the recovery of Klamath River Coho salmon, and (2) inclusion of additional information in the biennial reports on international compliance regarding the conservation of living marine resources.</p> <p>The title also repeals the requirement for annual reporting to Congress on bycatch reduction agreements.</p> <p>TITLE III--ALASKA SALMON RESEARCH TASK FORCE</p> <p><i>Alaska Salmon Research Task Force Act</i></p> <p>(Sec. 304) This title requires the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to convene an Alaska Salmon Research Task Force. The task force must review and report on research about the Pacific salmon in Alaska, identify applied research needed to better understand salmon migration and declining salmon returns in some regions of Alaska, and support sustainable management of salmon.</p> <p>TITLE IV--IUU TECHNICAL CORRECTIONS</p> <p>(Sec. 401) This title makes various technical corrections to the High Seas Driftnet Fishing Moratorium Protection Act.</p> <p>DIVISION T--SECURE 2.0 ACT OF 2022</p> <p><i>SECURE 2.0 Act of 2022</i></p> <p>TITLE I--EXPANDING COVERAGE AND INCREASING RETIREMENT SAVINGS</p> <p>This title makes various changes to expand incentives for employers to offer retirement plans, increase participation in employer-sponsored retirement plans, and increase the accumulation of savings in retirement plans. The changes impact private-sector defined contribution plans such as 401(k) plans, profit sharing and stock bonus plans, money purchase plans, and employee stock ownership plans; public sector or tax-exempt sector defined contribution plans such as 403(b) and 457(b) plans; and individual retirement accounts and annuities.</p> <p>(Sec. 101) This section generally requires new 401(k) and 403(b) retirement plans to automatically enroll eligible participants. The section includes exceptions for certain small businesses, new businesses, church plans, and governmental plans.</p> <p>(Sec. 102) This section increases the nonrefundable tax credits for small employers that start new retirement plans. First, it increases the credit from 50% to 100% of qualified start-up costs for employers with up to 50 employees. Second, it provides an additional credit based on a percentage of the employer's contribution to an employee's defined contribution retirement plan. The full credit, capped at $1,000 per employee, is available for employers with up to 50 employees. The credit phases out for employers with 51-100 employees.</p> <p>(Sec. 103) This section revises the nonrefundable tax credit for certain low- and middle-income taxpayers who contribute to certain qualified retirement accounts. Specifically, this section replaces the nonrefundable tax credit (commonly known as the saver's credit), with a federal government matching contribution to the taxpayer's individual retirement account (IRA) or retirement plan.</p> <p>(Sec. 104) This section requires the Department of the Treasury to promote public awareness of the federal government matching contribution.</p> <p>(Sec. 105) This section permits pooled employer plans (PEPs) to designate a named fiduciary (other than an employee of the plan) as the entity responsible for collecting contributions to the plan. Current law requires a PEP to designate a trustee to be responsible for collecting contributions and maintaining certain contribution-related policies and procedures. A PEP is a multiple employer retirement plan that allows unrelated employers to participate in a single defined contribution retirement plan.</p> <p>(Sec. 106) This section permits employers that sponsor 403(b) plans to participate in multiple employer plans (MEPs). A MEP is a plan maintained by two or more employers who are not related.</p> <p>(Sec. 107) This section increases the required minimum distribution (RMD) age from 72 to 75 in two steps over 10 years. The RMD age is the age at which a retirement plan participant or beneficiary must begin taking distributions. The RMD rules generally apply to participants and beneficiaries in IRAs (including traditional, SEP, and SIMPLE IRAs) and 401(k), 403(b), 457(b), profit sharing, and other defined contribution plans.</p> <p>(Sec. 108) This section indexes the catch-up contribution limit for individual retirement arrangements (IRAs) for individuals age 50 or older to inflation. Currently, the IRA catch-up contribution limit is $1,000 (not indexed).</p> <p>(Sec. 109) This section increases the annual limitation on catch-up contributions applicable to individuals ages 60, 61, 62, and 63. Generally, a catch-up contribution is an elective deferral by a retirement plan participant who is age 50 or older that exceeds a statutory limit, a plan-imposed limit, or the actual deferral percentage test limit for highly compensated employees.</p> <p>(Sec. 110) This section allows employer contributions on behalf of an employee for qualified student loan payments to be treated as employer matching contributions under 401(k), 403(b), SIMPLE IRAs, and governmental 457(b) plans.</p> <p>(Sec. 111) This section allows employers who join an existing pension plan (instead of establishing a separate plan) to take the tax credit for small employer pension plan start-up costs. This section is effective retroactively for taxable years beginning after December 13, 2019.</p> <p>(Sec. 112) This section provides a nonrefundable tax credit for small employers that make military-spouse employees eligible for participation in the employer's defined contribution retirement plan during the first two months of employment.</p> <p>(Sec. 113) This section permits employers to offer de minimis financial incentives (e.g., low-dollar gift cards) to encourage employee participation in the employer's 401(k) or 403(b) retirement plan. The section prohibits the use of plan assets to pay for the de minimis financial incentives.</p> <p>(Sec. 114) This section expands tax incentives for employee stock ownership plans (ESOPs) sponsored by S corporations. ESOPs are employer-sponsored defined contribution retirement plans that invest primarily in employer stock. Specifically, this section allows owners of stock in all non-publicly traded domestic corporations, including S corporations, to defer taxes on capital gains realized from selling their stock to an ESOP. Currently, the option to defer capital gains taxes is only available to owners of stock in a non-publicly traded C corporation who sell to an ESOP. Additionally, in the case of a sale of stock in an S corporation to an ESOP, the section limits the amount deferred to 10% of capital gains realized from the sale.</p> <p>(Sec. 115) This section allows certain penalty-free early withdrawals from tax-preferred retirement accounts for emergency personal expenses. Under current law, the Internal Revenue Code imposes an early withdrawal tax on distributions made from tax-preferred retirement accounts, such as IRAs and 401ks, before an individual attains age 59 1/2. The early withdrawal tax does not apply in some circumstances.</p> <p>(Sec. 116) This section increases the contribution an employer may make to a SIMPLE (Savings Incentive Match Plan for Employees) IRA or SIMPLE 401(k) plan. SIMPLE IRAs and SIMPLE 401(k) plans are simplified tax-advantaged retirement accounts often provided by small businesses.</p> <p>(Sec. 117) This section increases the annual limits for employee contributions and catch-up contributions to a SIMPLE IRA or SIMPLE 401(k) plan.</p> <p>(Sec. 118) This section exempts from the 10% excise tax on excess (nondeductible) contributions an employer's contributions to a simplified employee pension (SEP) IRA which are not deductible solely because they are not made in connection with a trade or business of the employer (e.g., contributions on behalf of a household employee). A SEP IRA is an employer-sponsored retirement plan where only the employer contributes to the plan and the employer contributes the same amount for each employee.</p> <p>(Sec. 119) This section removes the compensation-based limit on annual benefits under defined benefit plans for participants in rural electric cooperative plans who are not considered to be highly compensated employees.</p> <p>(Sec. 120) This section exempts from the tax on specified prohibited transactions the receipt of fees and compensation by an automatic portability provider in connection with an automatic transfer from an IRA established in connection with a distribution from a former employer's plan into an employer-sponsored defined contribution retirement plan in which the individual is an active participant. The transfer may only occur if the individual has been given advance notice of the transfer and has not affirmatively opted out of the transfer. </p> <p>Labor must issue guidance and studies related to the exemption. Treasury must issue a report on automatic distribution notices.</p> <p>(Sec. 121) This section creates two new types of plans--a starter 401(k) and a safe harbor 403(b)--for employers that do not offer a retirement plan. Among other features of these plans, employees generally enroll with a deferral rate between 3% and 15%. The limit on annual deferrals is $6,000 (indexed for inflation).</p> <p>(Sec. 122) This section requires Treasury to provide states with the contact information of owners of unredeemed savings bonds that are more than three years past their date of final maturity.</p> <p>(Sec. 123) This section revises the rules with respect to ESOPs to permit certain non-exchange traded securities to qualify as publicly traded employer securities if the security meets certain requirements.</p> <p>(Sec. 124) This section increases from 26 to 46 the age before which a qualifying disability must occur for an individual to be eligible for a tax-advantaged ABLE (Achieving Better Life Experience) account. ABLE accounts are designed to enable individuals with disabilities to save for and pay for disability-related expenses. To establish an account, an individual must have a qualifying impairment that began before the individual attained the age threshold.</p> <p>(Sec. 125) This section reduces from three years to two years the maximum period of consecutive part-time service an employer may require before an employee is eligible for participation in the employer's 401(k) plan. The section also applies this requirement and other coverage requirements for long-term, part-time workers to 403(b) plans that are subject to ERISA.</p> <p>(Sec. 126) This section permits certain rollovers from 529 college savings accounts to Roth IRAs without a tax penalty if the 529 account has been maintained for at least 15 years and certain other conditions are met.</p> <p>(Sec. 127) This section creates pension-linked emergency savings accounts, which are short-terms savings accounts established and maintained as part of an individual account plan (e.g., a 401(k) or other defined contribution plan). The section sets forth requirements and features of the emergency savings accounts, including a requirement that savings accounts are funded with after-tax Roth contributions.</p> <p>(Sec. 128) This section permits 403(b) plans with custodial accounts to invest in collective investment trusts for the purposes of tax law. (In order to permit 403(b) plans with custodial accounts to invest in collective investment trusts, certain modifications to securities laws will also be required.)</p> <p>TITLE II--PRESERVATION OF INCOME</p> <p>(Sec. 201) This section permits commercial annuities issued in connection with a defined contribution employer plan or an individual retirement account or annuity to satisfy RMD requirements even if the commercial annuities provide certain types of payments, such as annual payment increases of less than 5%, payments of dividends and distributions, and certain lump sum payments.</p> <p>(Sec. 202) This section directs Treasury to revise its regulations governing qualifying longevity annuity contracts (QLACs). QLACs generally are deferred annuities that begin payment at the end of an individual's life expectancy.</p> <p>Under the existing regulations, premiums paid for a qualifying QLAC cannot exceed both a dollar limitation ($145,000 for 2022) and a percentage limitation. This section repeals the requirement that premiums for QLACs be limited to 25% of an individual's account balance and permits the use of up to $200,000 (indexed for inflation) from an account balance to purchase a QLAC.</p> <p>The section also requires Treasury to make certain changes intended to facilitate the sale of QLACs with spousal survivor rights.</p> <p>(Sec. 203) This section directs Treasury to revise its rules to facilitate the use of exchange-traded funds as investment options in variable contracts (e.g., variable annuity life insurance policies). Exchange-traded funds are collective investment products registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission the shares of which, unlike mutual funds, are traded on a national stock exchange at market prices.</p> <p>(Sec. 204) This section directs Treasury to amend its RMD regulations to allow an employee who has an individual account in a defined contribution plan that is partially annuitized (i.e., that holds annuity contracts and other assets) to elect to calculate the RMD amount by aggregating the value of the annuities and the other portion of the account balance.</p> <p>TITLE III--SIMPLIFICATION AND CLARIFICATION OF RETIREMENT PLAN RULES</p> <p>This title modifies rules governing the design, implementation, and administration of retirement plans that qualify for preferred tax treatment (i.e., tax-qualified retirement plans) under the Internal Revenue Code (IRC).</p> <p>The title also makes changes to the regulation of employee benefit plans under the Employee Retirement Security Income Act of 1974 (ERISA). ERISA establishes minimum standards and requirements intended to protect plan participants and beneficiaries in most private sector employer-sponsored retirement and health plans.</p> <p>The title addresses issues such as error correction requirements, withdrawal and distribution rules, and notice and disclosure rules.</p> <p>(Sec. 301) This section establishes new rules applicable to inadvertent overpayments by plans under ERISA and the IRC. A fiduciary does not breach fiduciary duty for failing to recover an inadvertent overpayment. Also, a plan will not fail to be tax-qualified because it does not recover an inadvertent overpayment. The section sets forth applicable requirements and conditions.</p> <p>(Sec. 302) This section reduces the excise tax on a taxpayer who fails to satisfy the RMD requirements under a qualified retirement plan or 457(b) plan. Specifically, it reduces the excise tax from 50% to 25% of the amount by which the minimum required distribution exceeds the amount actually distributed and further reduces the excise tax to 10% for a taxpayer who corrects the error during a two-year correction window.</p> <p>(Sec. 303) This section directs Labor to establish an online searchable database&#8212;the Retirement Savings Lost and Found&#8212;to allow individuals to search for information and locate the administrator of various plans.</p> <p>(Sec. 304) This section raises the cap from $5,000 to $7,000 on the amount of vested accrued benefits that a qualified retirement plan may involuntarily distribute to an IRA (or cash out if under $1,000), such as when a job change occurs.</p> <p>(Sec. 305) This section expands the Employee Plans Compliance Resolution System (EPCRS) to allow any eligible inadvertent failure to comply with rules under specified sections of the IRC to be self-corrected under the EPCRS, unless the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) identifies the error first or the self-correction was not completed in a reasonable time. The term <i>eligible inadvertent failure </i>means a failure that occurs despite the existence of practices and procedures that satisfy IRS standards or similar standards in the case of an individual retirement plan.</p> <p>The section also directs the IRS to expand the EPCRS to allow (1) custodians of individual retirement accounts and annuities to address eligible inadvertent failures, including waivers of the excise tax that would otherwise apply; and (2) certain eligible inadvertent failures related to a loan from a plan to be self-corrected.</p> <p>(Sec. 306) This section allows participants in governmental 457(b) plans to change their deferral rate at any time before the compensation is available (instead of prior to the beginning of the month in which the deferral will be made).</p> <p>(Sec. 307) This section expands the tax deduction for qualified charitable distributions (QCDs). A <i>QCD </i>is a nontaxable distribution by a taxpayer aged 70 1/2 or older transferred directly from a traditional or Roth IRA to a charitable organization. Currently, the maximum annual exclusion is $100,000 (not indexed). This section indexes the $100,000 maximum annual exclusion to inflation.

Currently, an employer-sponsored defined contribution plan that is top heavy (i.e., more than 60% of the aggregate accrued benefits or account balances are for certain key employees) must satisfy certain minimum vesting and minimum benefit requirements to maintain its tax-qualified status. This section allows the plan to exclude employees who do not meet the minimum age or service requirements in determining whether the plan satisfies minimum vesting and minimum benefit requirements.</p> <p>(Sec. 311) This section restricts to three years the period during which a qualified birth or adoption distribution may be repaid to a retirement plan. Current law allows an individual to take a penalty-free early distribution from certain defined contribution retirement plans of up to $5,000 for a qualified birth or adoption.</p> <p>(Sec. 312) This section allows 401(k) and 403(b) plans to rely on an employee's written self-certification that a deemed hardship distribution is due to an immediate and heavy financial need and is limited to the amount required to satisfy that financial need.

Specifically, the section provides that ongoing plan disclosures are not required to be provided to unenrolled participants so long as the unenrolled participants are provided with an annual reminder of their eligibility to participate in the plan and any documents they request.</p> <p>(Sec. 321) This section directs Labor to review its interpretive bulletin related to the fiduciary standards when selecting an annuity provider for a defined benefit pension plan and consult with the ERISA advisory council to determine if changes are needed. It also requires Labor to report on its findings, including an assessment of any risk to participants.</p> <p>(Sec. 322) This section modifies the tax treatment of certain IRAs involved in a prohibited transaction (e.g., a transaction where an IRA buys investment property from the IRA owner). Currently, if there is a prohibited transaction in an IRA, the IRA loses its tax-favored status and the fair market value of the assets in the entire IRA are treated as distributed to the owner. This section specifies that if an individual has multiple IRAs, they are treated separately with respect to prohibited transactions.</p> <p>(Sec. 323) This section specifies that the exemption from the 10% additional tax on early withdrawals from retirement plans for distributions that are substantially equal periodic payments made over the account owner's life expectancy applies in the case of a rollover of the account, an exchange of the annuity providing the payments, or an annuity that meets the RMD requirements.</p> <p>(Sec. 324) This section directs Treasury to develop and issue guidance in the form of sample forms to simplify, standardize, facilitate, and expedite the completion of rollovers to eligible retirement plans and trustee-to-trustee transfers from an IRA to another individual retirement account or annuity.</p> <p>(Sec. 325) This section exempts designated Roth accounts that are included in employer-sponsored retirement plans from the RMD rules prior to the participant's death.</p> <p>(Sec. 326) This section allows penalty-free early distributions from retirement plans for individuals who have a terminal illness.</p> <p>(Sec. 327) This section permits surviving spouses to elect to be treated as the deceased employee for purposes of the RMD requirements.</p> <p>(Sec. 328) This section eliminates the requirement that certain distributions from a governmental retirement plan for the health or long-term care insurance premiums of a retired public safety officer must be paid directly to the insurance plan for such amount to be excluded from the retired officer's gross income.</p> <p>(Sec. 329) This section exempts from the 10% additional tax on early withdrawals distributions under a governmental plan to public safety employees with at least 25 years of service under the plan, regardless of their age.</p> <p>(Sec. 330) This section extends the public safety employee exception to the 10% additional tax on early withdrawals to distributions under a governmental plan to corrections officers and certain forensic security employees.</p> <p>(Sec. 331) This section allows penalty-free early withdrawals from retirement plans in connection with a federally declared disaster. It permits distributions of up to $22,000 per participant, per disaster.</p> <p>(Sec. 332) This section permits an employer to replace a SIMPLE IRA plan with a safe harbor 401(k) plan at any time during the year. The section also provides a waiver of certain rollover rules for a conversion of a SIMPLE IRA to a 401(k) plan or 403(b) plan.</p> <p>(Sec. 333) This section allows penalty-free early withdrawals from an IRA of any excess contribution amount (and associated earnings) included in a corrective distribution.</p> <p>(Sec. 334) This section permits employer-sponsored defined contribution retirement plans to make penalty-free distributions of up to $2,500 per year (inflation adjusted) to pay the premiums for long-term care insurance that meets certain standards.</p> <p>(Sec. 335) This section directs Treasury to revise its minimum funding regulations for defined benefit plans to limit the mortality improvement rate that is used to calculate the present value of a stream of expected future benefit payments.</p> <p>(Sec. 336) This section requires the Government Accountability Office to report on the effectiveness of notices provided by plans to participants about distributions eligible for rollover treatment.</p> <p>(Sec. 337) This section modifies the RMD rules for special needs trusts, including by allowing the special needs trust to provide for a charitable organization as the remainder beneficiary.</p> <p>(Sec. 338) This section requires a certain number of periodic benefit statements to be provided in paper form.

Currently, the regulation requires plan administrators to disclose certain plan and investment-related information, including fee and expense information, to participants and beneficiaries. This section requires Labor to explore improvements to enhance participants' understanding of fees and expenses related to a defined contribution plan under ERISA, as well as the cumulative effect of the fees and expenses on retirement savings over time.</p> <p>(Sec. 341) This section directs Labor and Treasury to adopt regulations providing that a plan can consolidate certain required notices.</p> <p>(Sec. 342) This section requires a pension plan administrator that is amending the plan in order to provide participants with the option to elect a lump sum payment to provide the participants with certain information about the available benefit options, including an explanation about how the lump sum was calculated.</p> <p>(Sec. 343) This section modifies requirements regarding the annual funding notices for a defined benefit plan, including by requiring the plan to provide the average return on assets for the plan year.</p> <p>(Sec. 344) This section requires Labor to report on the pooled employer plan (PEP) industry.

For such an application, the FDA shall also allow the application to rely on or reference data and information concerning the technology's use in the manufacturing of other drugs.</p> <p>Chapter 2--Transparency, Program Integrity, and Regulatory Improvements</p> <p>(Sec. 3221) This section modifies the FDA's authority to impose safe disposal requirements as part of a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy for a drug.</p> <p>Currently, the FDA may require that a drug be dispensed with a safe disposal packaging or safe disposal system that renders the drug nonretrievable. Under this section, the FDA may impose such safe disposal requirements without regard to whether the drug is rendered nonretrievable.</p> <p>(Sec. 3222) This section requires the FDA to provide a therapeutic equivalence rating for certain new drug applications if a request is made in the application.</p> <p>Generally, this requirement shall apply to an application for a new prescription drug (1) that relies on information from studies not conducted by the applicant and that the applicant does not have a right to reference or use (commonly referred to as a 505(b)(2) application), and (2) where the only differences between the new drug and a listed drug are certain differences involving inactive ingredients.</p> <p>A drug is a therapeutic equivalent of another if they produce the same clinical effect and have the same safety profile. Typically, for certain generic drugs, the FDA rates the therapeutic equivalence of that generic drug to another drug, such as the brand name version. Currently, an applicant seeking approval of a drug through a 505(b)(2) application typically only receives an equivalence rating by requesting one from the FDA in a separate petition.</p> <p>This section also imposes deadlines for the FDA to provide a requested therapeutic equivalence rating.</p> <p>(Sec. 3223) This section requires the FDA to solicit comments about the factors that the FDA should consider when reviewing requests by drug manufacturers to change the third-party vendors engaged to help implement and manage risk evaluation and mitigation strategies. The GAO must report to Congress on such vendor changes and any issues involving patient access to the drug that stemmed from such a change.</p> <p>(Sec. 3224) This section revises the requirements for a provision that allows a generic drug seeking FDA approval to have different labeling from the listed version of the drug, including deadlines for the sponsor of the generic drug to agree to revise the labeling.</p> <p>Subtitle C--Medical Devices</p> <p>(Sec. 3301) This section authorizes the manufacturer of certain medical devices with an emergency use authorization to submit a single submission to the FDA to request both (1) a medical device classification, and (2) a determination that the device uses a simple laboratory examination or procedure approved for home use that poses an insignificant risk of an erroneous result.</p> <p>Specifically, a manufacturer may use this single submission procedure if the FDA, when granting an emergency use authorization, determined that the device uses such a simple examination or procedure.</p> <p>(Sec. 3302) This section requires the FDA to convene at least one panel of the Medical Devices Advisory Committee each year to provide advice to the FDA concerning medical devices used in pandemic preparedness and response.</p> <p>(Sec. 3303) This section requires the GAO to report to Congress on an existing FDA program for third-party reviewers to provide recommendations relating to the classification of medical devices, including an audit of the performance of such reviewers.</p> <p>(Sec. 3304) This section modifies requirements related to certificates to foreign governments (an export certificate that certifies that a medical device marketed in the United States meets various legal and regulatory requirements).</p> <p>(Sec. 3305) This section requires an applicant submitting certain applications to the FDA pertaining to a medical device, such as a request for a classification of the medical device, to take certain actions if the medical device qualifies as a cyber device.</p> <p>Under this section, a cyber device is generally a medical device with software that connects to the internet and contains technical characteristics that could be vulnerable to cybersecurity threats.</p> <p>The applicant for such a device must (1) submit to the FDA a plan to monitor and address postmarket cybersecurity vulnerabilities and exploits, (2) develop and maintain processes and procedures to provide reasonable reassurance that the device is secure from cybersecurity threats, (3) make available patches and updates for the device to address cybersecurity threats, and (4) comply with any related requirements the FDA may require through regulation.</p> <p>This section prohibits selling cyber devices that fail to meet such requirements.</p> <p>The GAO shall report on the cybersecurity challenges facing medical devices, including legacy devices that may not support certain software security updates.</p> <p>(Sec. 3306) This section authorizes the FDA to ban specific intended uses of a medical device if that use presents an unreasonable or substantial injury risk. (In 2021, a federal appeals court ruled that the current statute, which authorizes the FDA to ban a medical device for posing such a risk, does not authorize the FDA to ban only specific uses of a device.)</p> <p>(Sec. 3307) This section requires the FDA to take certain actions if it makes a decision related to a medical device based on information provided by an FDA-funded third party. For example, if the FDA relies on data, analytical code, results, or other information from such third parties to support a regulatory decision, the FDA must provide, to the extent possible, a summary of such information to the manufacturers impacted by that decision.</p> <p>(Sec. 3308) This section waives certain requirements for medical device manufacturers making changes to a device if the changes are consistent with an FDA-approved predetermined change control plan.</p> <p>Generally, a predetermined change control plan describes planned changes that may be made to a medical device, where the device would remain safe and effective even if the change was not made.</p> <p>If a manufacturer makes a change that is consistent with an FDA-approved plan to a device that has received premarket approval, the manufacturer shall not be required to file a supplemental application, even if such a change would otherwise require a supplemental application.</p> <p>If a manufacturer makes a change that is consistent with an FDA-approved plan to a device that has been cleared by the FDA, the manufacturer shall not be required to make a premarket notification.</p> <p>(Sec. 3309) This section authorizes the FDA to waive the annual establishment registration fee for small businesses after the initial registration fee. For the purpose of this waiver, a small business is generally one that reported $1 million or less in gross receipts or sales in its most recent federal tax return. (Generally, establishments involved in the production and distribution of medical devices for U.S. commercial distribution are required to register annually with the FDA and pay a fee with each registration.)</p> <p>Subtitle D--Infant Formula</p> <p>(Sec. 3401) This section addresses shortages in critical foods (i.e., infant formula and medical foods).</p> <p>A manufacturer of a critical food must notify the FDA of a permanent discontinuance or interruption in the manufacture of the critical food that is likely to lead to a meaningful disruption of the food's supply in the United States. If the FDA determines that a shortage of the critical food is likely to result, the FDA must provide the Department of Agriculture (USDA) certain information about the shortage.</p> <p>After providing such information to USDA about an infant formula shortage, the FDA must shorten the premarket registration requirement for marketing a new infant formula to 30 days before marketing a new infant formula, whereas typically an entity must register at least 90 days before marketing a new formula. The FDA shall use this shortened premarket registration requirement for a period of at least 90 days, or as long as appropriate to prevent or mitigate an infant formula shortage.</p> <p>The FDA must also respond to certain manufacturer submissions required for infant formula within 45 days of receiving the submission, whereas currently there is no statutory deadline for such responses.</p> <p>If there is a shortage of specialty infant formula (generally a formula for infants with an unusual medical or dietary problem, such as low birth weight), the FDA may waive statutory requirements to facilitate the importation of such specialty formula.</p> <p>This section also authorizes individuals to import up to a three-month supply of infant formula for personal use from Canada, the European Union, or any country that is implementing and enforcing formula safety and nutritional adequacy requirements that are similar to U.S. requirements.</p> <p>This section also imposes requirements related to infant formula recalls, such as requiring (1) a manufacturer of a recalled infant formula to provide certain information and plans to the FDA, (2) the FDA to provide a list of required actions after an inspection of a manufacturing facility impacted by a recall, and (3) the FDA to notify Congress within 24 hours of initiating a recall.</p> <p>The FDA must conduct annual inspections of infant formula manufacturing facilities. To meet this requirement, the FDA may rely on inspections conducted by foreign regulatory authorities and state agencies, as appropriate.</p> <p>The FDA must also establish the Office of Critical Foods, which shall be responsible for oversight, coordination, and facilitation of activities related to critical foods.</p> <p>Furthermore, the FDA must (1) develop and issue a national strategy on infant formula to increase the resiliency of the infant formula supply chain, (2) publish on its website information on how to identify appropriate substitutes for infant formula that are relied upon by infants and other individuals with serious health conditions, and (3) meet with representatives from other countries to discuss ways to harmonize regulatory requirements for infant formula.</p> <p>Subtitle E--Cosmetics</p> <p><i>Modernization of Cosmetics Regulation Act of 2022</i></p> <p>This subtitle requires cosmetics brands and manufacturer s (referred to as responsible persons) to register with the F DA, provides the FDA with various regulatory authorities, and addresses related issues.</p> <p>(Sec. 3502) The FDA must establish by regul ation good manufacturing practices designed to protect public health and ensure that cosmetics products are not adulterated.</p> <p>Responsible persons must register with the FDA their manufacturing and processing facilities. Each registration must contain certain information, such as the facility's address, contact information, and the brands of the cosmetics manufactured or processed at the facility.</p> <p>The FDA may suspend a facility registration for various reasons, including if the registrant's product has a reasonable probability of causing serious adverse health consequences and the problem cannot be isolated to certain products. The section establishes certain requirements pertaining to such suspensions, such as requiring (1) the FDA to provide the registrant with an opportunity for an informal hearing no later than five days after issuing the suspension, and (2) the registrant to submit a corrective action plan if the suspension remains in place after the hearing.</p> <p>This section also requires responsible persons to register with the FDA each cosmetic product every year. Each registration must contain certain information, such as the registration number of each manufacturing or processing facility and a list of ingredients.</p> <p>Each responsible person for a cosmetic product must maintain records (e.g., tests and studies) that support a reasonable certainty that the product is safe. Coal-tar hair dye shall be subject to different requirements.</p> <p>If a responsible person receives a report of a serious adverse event (generally an event resulting in death, hospitalization, or other health problems) involving a cosmetic product in the United States, the responsible person must submit the report to the FDA no later than 15 days after initially receiving the report. A responsible person must also maintain certain records related to such reports.</p> <p>The section also imposes certain labeling requirements for cosmetic products, such as requiring (1) labels to identify any fragrance allergens in a product, and (2) products intended only for professional use to contain a clear and prominent statement saying that the product is intended only for use by licensed professionals.</p> <p>Furthermore, the FDA may order a mandatory recall of a cosmetic product where there is a reasonable possibility that the product fails to meet certain regulatory requirements and the use of the product will cause serious adverse health consequences. The subtitle imposes various requirements related to such authorities, such as requiring the FDA to give the responsible person subject to the recall (1) an opportunity to voluntarily recall the product or cease distribution, and (2) an opportunity for an informal hearing no later than 10 days after the order.</p> <p>(Sec. 3503) This section prohibits the sale of products that fail to meet certain requirements established by this subtitle, such as the registration requirements, with certain exceptions.</p> <p>(Sec. 3504) The FDA is authorized to inspect various records related to the requirements established by this subtitle.</p> <p>(Sec. 3505) The FDA must establish regulations to require standardized testing methods for detecting asbestos in talc-containing cosmetics products.</p> <p>(Sec. 3506) The FDA must assess the safety of using of perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, commonly referred to as PFAS, in cosmetic products.</p> <p>Subtitle F--Cross-Cutting Provisions</p> <p>Chapter 1--Clinical Trial Diversity and Modernization</p> <p>This chapter addresses issues related to clinical trials, including the diversity of clinical trial populations.</p> <p>(Sec. 3601) The chapter requires certain clinical studies related to an application for a new drug or medical device to include a diversity action plan. Such a plan shall include (1) goals for enrollment in the study, (2) the rationale for such goals, and (3) an explanation of how the applicant intends to meet those goals.</p> <p>(Sec. 3602) The FDA must issue or revise guidance relating to such diversity action plans.</p> <p>(Sec. 3603) The FDA must solicit input on increasing the enrollment of historically underrepresented populations in clinical studies.</p> <p>(Sec. 3605) This section requires the FDA to convene a public meeting to discuss FDA recommendations provided during the COVID-19 emergency period on mitigating disruption to clinical studies, including how such recommendations can be used to improve diversity in the patient populations in clinical studies.</p> <p>(Sec. 3606) The FDA must issue or revise draft guidance with recommendations related to using decentralized clinical studies to support the development of drugs and devices, including how decentralized trials can help improve the diversity of the clinical trial population.</p> <p>(Sec. 3607) The FDA must issue or revise draft guidance (1) on using digital health technologies to help improve recruitment and participation in clinical trials; and (2) on the use of seamless, concurrent, and other innovative clinical trial designs to support the expedited development and review of drugs.</p> <p>The FDA must also, as appropriate, work with foreign regulators to facilitate international harmonization on the regulation of decentralized clinical trials and innovative clinical trial designs.</p> <p>Chapter 2--Inspections</p> <p>This chapter addresses the FDA's authority to conduct inspections.</p> <p>(Sec. 3611) Currently, the FDA has expanded inspection authority for facilities that manufacture or process restricted medical devices, which are devices subject to heightened FDA regulations, such as those that may only be used or sold with authorization by a licensed medical practitioner. Under this section, the FDA shall have this expanded inspection authority even for facilities that only handle medical devices that are not restricted.</p> <p>(Sec. 3612) This section states that the FDA has the authority, subject to various requirements, to enter certain sites to inspect records to ensure the accuracy and reliability of studies and records and to assess compliance with legal requirements.</p> <p>(Sec. 3613) For the purposes of conducting risk-based inspections of establishments in foreign countries, the FDA shall consider, in addition to other factors, the compliance history of establishments in the country or region where the establishment is located. The FDA must also periodically assess, for the purposes of inspecting foreign establishments, whether additional arrangements or agreements with a foreign government are appropriate.</p> <p>(Sec. 3614) The GAO must report to Congress on inspections of foreign establishments conducted by the FDA and by foreign governments.</p> <p>(Sec. 3615) This section establishes a pilot program to increase unannounced surveillance inspections of foreign human drug establishments. The FDA shall evaluate the differences between such inspections on foreign and domestic establishments.</p> <p>Chapter 3--Miscellaneous</p> <p>(Sec. 3621) This section requires the FDA to regulate any contrast agent, radioactive drug, or over-the-counter (OTC) monograph drug as a drug and not a medical device. (Generally, an OTC monograph drug is a nonprescription drug without an approved FDA application where the drug must meet the requirements set out in a document known as a monograph.)</p> <p>For a product that is now regulated as a drug under this section but was legally marketed as a medical device on September 30, 2022, the FDA shall waive certain application fees.</p> <p>(Sec. 3622) This section requires the FDA's Office of Women's Health to review and update if necessary the Women's Health Research Roadmap and brief Congress on the review.</p> <p>(Sec. 3623) This section requires the FDA to develop and begin the implementation of a strategic workforce plan to recruit, train, and retain the workforce needed to support the FDA's public health mission.</p> <p>(Sec. 3624) This section authorizes the FDA to use certain enhanced hiring authorities to hire outstanding and qualified candidates in scientific, technical, and professional positions to support the regulation of food and cosmetics.</p> <p>(Sec. 3625) This section modifies various FDA fees, including fees relating to new drug applications and biosimilar applications.</p> <p>(Sec. 3626) This section revises requirements related to the reauthorization of FDA fees.</p> <p>(Sec. 3627) This section requires the FDA to periodically report to Congress a coordinated strategic plan to modernize the FDA's information technology systems.

(Similar authorities were in effect during 2022 under a nationwide waiver that was issued by USDA.)</p> <p>Additionally, the section directs USDA to establish a permanent, nationwide summer electronic benefit transfer (Summer EBT) program beginning in the summer of 2024 to provide nutrition assistance benefits at a rate of $40 per eligible child per month during the summer. The amount may be proportionately higher, consistent with certain adjustments that have been established to reflect the higher costs of providing meals in certain states and territories. The amount must also be adjusted annually for inflation after 2024. USDA must also make payments to states that are equal to 50% of the administrative costs incurred by the states in operating Summer EBT.</p> <p>This section also modifies the Pandemic EBT (P-EBT) program to prohibit states from providing P-EBT benefits in the summer of 2023 to children who did not attend a school at the end of the 2022-2023 school year that participated in the National School Lunch Program or the School Breakfast Program (e.g., children who were homeschooled or enrolled in fully virtual institutions).</p> <p>(Sec. 503) This section reduces certain nutrition assistance benefits that were provided in response to COVID-19, including by (1) limiting P-EBT benefits in summer 2023 to $120 per child, and (2) ending SNAP emergency allotments after February 2023.</p> <p>TITLE V--OTHER MATTERS</p> <p>(Sec. 601) This section directs USDA to make pandemic assistance payments to cotton merchandisers that purchased cotton from a U.S. cotton producer or marketed cotton on behalf of a U.S. cotton producer between March 1, 2020, and the enactment of this act.</p> <p>(Sec. 602) This section directs USDA to make a one-time payment to each rice producer on a farm in the United States with respect to the 2022 crop year.</p> <p>(Sec. 603) This section specifies that the provisions of H.R. 5608 (Chronic Wasting Disease Research and Management Act) of the 117th Congress, are hereby enacted into law.
